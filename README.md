I was born, I went to school, some years later I graduated from university and I lost myself. Now, I'm just trying to create new things.

\* Every project contains a file called `docs.md` in the root folder containing the information for understanging the project.

### Comunity ([./com](/com))

~~This is where I save the projects where I save the atworks I made for contest or challenges.~~ *Trying to do cool things*
