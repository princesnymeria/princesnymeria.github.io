## Orbit

### Orbits in orbits

>I calculate two circular orbits at different speeds and draw a line with high transparency between the "planets". For extra fun, the inner planet is orbiting around a center that is itself in orbit. in p5.js

### Rhythm

![](shrynx_1-rhythm.png)

>Thanks for the generative art history lesson u/dmitricherniak , always very curious on how techniques emerges ðŸ˜Šand astonished how peculiarly similar the pieces are !
>
>To further breakdown my piece:
>if you follow okazzsp code in tweet and play with noise parameters, beautiful branching like pattern emerges . some of his other artworks also have it.
>The original piece has algorithm for packing circles and rectangle together. i used only circles for packing as i had my own circle packing library https://github.com/shrynx/circle-packing, it follow simple growth algorithm but with lot of flexibility. ( and if you are wondering No! most of my code is never this well documented or structured ðŸ˜›)originally this was written for a complete different piece and grew over time https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/h15vcq/untitled/
>Following advice from tyler hobbs essays i chose non overlapping flow field starting points using circle packing
>
>Some circles are left empty, kept this stylistic choice from okazzsp and rest are filled with tiny circles. This was inspired from manoloide's mantel https://www.behance.net/gallery/62172035/mantel . Probably my all time favourite generative art piece.
>
>And finally the last piece of puzzle, i tried couple of palettes and settled oncolours from kandinsky's white zig zags.
>
>Hope this gives some insights to explore them further ðŸ˜€

### The only good thing we got going

![](dmitricherniak-the_only_good_thing_we_got_going.png)

>What's your guess on how it works? I've give you a hint, it uses vector fields as per https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2020/flow-fields

>its parameters of the circle packing + an additional element that comes in from the programmatic and statistical coloring that blanks out circles that are the same color as the background. So you'll see some empty spots, and those are because a circle the same color as the bg was original placed there, but then excluded.

>Of course the lines are a function of the noise via the flow fields and the parameters involved there help give it the balance and harmony. Here's some more examples w other colors: https://twitter.com/dmitricherniak/status/1214888292421951488

![](ejgen-circles.png)

>I draw a circle with 5 small circles around the perimeter, and iterate that 5-deep. The movie is just me increasing the relative size of each level of circles. Most of the action is in the center, where the different circles interact, but there are moments of clarity and almost-clarity in other regions as well. In p5.js.

### medley

![](degenerativecode-medley.webp)

>I make a custom field of vectors (because I was fed up of using perlin) represented by a 2D array. Then I place a particle in it and make it step forward by a length of its diameter in the direction of the field 'cell' it is in. This makes a strip of particles that just touch each other.
>
>Repeat this process, adding a function that checks for collisions before adding a new particle to the list.
>
>Repeat until canvas is filled.
>
>Colours are controlled with a hard coded colour scheme that I generated. I use a process that decides where the main blocks of colour should be with a %chance to pick a random colour from the scheme.
>
>That's the main gist of the algorithm.

### Dividing-Aggregating Walkers - A new technique to generate natural-looking patterns using random walkers

![](cipheredxyz-dividing_aggregating_walkers.webp)

>Really nice ! Yes this is almost the same, at least the core principles are the same ! I think the main difference is on the walking step, in your example, the angle is applied at each iteration to the direction, am I guessing correctly ?
>
>I think my solution tends to produce more "natural-looking" patterns precisely due to the higher potentiel in diversity coming from the way the walking step in handled (the paths tend to look more random-ish).
>
>Nonetheless these are very close ideas, I will link your project at the end of my article since this is a very similar idea, are you okay with that ? It's nice to see that someone has already thought of this technique, as I found it to be quite elegant :)
