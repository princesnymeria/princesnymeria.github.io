# The Arcadian Cantos: a poem without an author

<small>Clipped from: https://deponysum.com/2021/02/23/poem/</small>

GPT-3 is a powerful neural network that has been trained to "write" by feeding it millions of pages from the internet, having it learn the patterns in text. These patterns include millions of lines of poetry. GPT-3 can be used to "complete" prompts. You can learn more about GPT-3 here: [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3)

With GPT-3 in mind I conceived an idea- create a poem made up of a composite of some of the best and most famous poetry ever written by humans in English, and the words of a machine, with a few words of my own thrown in (5-10%) mostly for bridging purposes. The goal: to create a poem without an author.

I love poetry. I love the way it alludes, rises and flows through language. Really good poetry transcends time and place, not through abstraction, but through linking concrete things together. It is constantly alluded to in other writing, and constantly alludes to other writing. This transcendence by particularity gives it a freedom; poetry has always escaped its author more than any other form of writing. I know that sounds like gibberish or so much postmodern rubbish, but I really mean it in a quite direct sense. I hope to show it to you.

Could a poem partly written by computer be said to have a single meaning?- even less so than a normal poem, surely. Yet as I selecting chunks of famous poetry, and picking from alternate outputs by the computer, a theme did emerge despite myself, gaining moment as the sections progressed, becoming, if anything, a little too clear- a poem about thwarted, tragic gay love. See I found that GPT-3 dealt well with love and death, so the content I fed it continued to amplify in that direction Does this show that my pretensions that this is an authorless piece are nonsense? Both yes and no, but I'll leave the elaboration for others.

Not all of poetry written by humans that I have included is famous, and some it wasn't originally intended as poetry at all.

**If you would like to see a version of the poem colour coded to indicate the bits written by poets, the bits written by GPT-3 and the bits written by yours truly, [you can click here](https://deponysum.com/2020/08/16/2233/). Personally I think the poem is best first enjoyed without knowledge of who wrote what.**

I am indebted to AIDungeon, who made access to GPT-3 possible for me when otherwise it wouldn't be. It's a super fun text adventure game, where the outcomes are written by a computer. AIDungeon were not aware of this project, so don't blame them if you don't like it. You can check out AI dungeon at: [**https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home**](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home)

### 1\. Call me by your function

>
>Dispatched me at their leisure….
>
>Well, what then? Should I not hear, as I lie down in dust,
>

### 3\. Silica sand and desert dreams

#### I

>We wander among dry words
>
>There is no time for any now

>
>If some can still find room for one poor soul
>

>And voice and hands of one who smiled
>
>On all the common things of life,

#### III

>"Oh but I see that dread desert!"
>
>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
>The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
>And on the pedestal these words appear:
>
>"Oh but I see that dread desert!"
>If it is more than but a moment thereafter
>Let me be damned, but I swear on a soul I see
>
>A vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
>Troubling my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
>A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
>A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
>Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
>Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
>The darkness drops again; but now I know
>That twenty centuries of stony sleep
>Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle.

#### III

And when my heart is nearly torn,

I spread my sails, and turn away.

"Thamus, are you there? When you reach Palodes,

take care to proclaim that the great god Pan is dead."

You stare, you are all ears.

"Do not forget," the whisper dies in the last of the year,

"That Pan is dead!"

"Gorgon, what do you mean?"

"That great god Pan is dead!"

Your heart leaps with joy, then sinks within you with pain.

Ah! Could you but have believed it!

You feel your face turning red,

Then white as any ghost can be. You touch your burning throat.

**Notes**

Section 1: The sources are the names of the books of the Pentateuch "creatively" turned into a sentence in English ("in the beginning", "names"  "were called" "in the desert of" "things"), Sufjan Steven's songs from "Call Me by Your Name" and the Four Quartets by T.S Eliot.

Section 2: The source is "Tetelestai" by Conrad Aiken

Section 3: The sources are the well known "Ozymandias" by Shelley and "The Second Coming" by Yeats.

Section 4: Twa Corbies by unknown & Adonais by Shelley

Section 5: Marx & Joyce

Section 6: McAuley and Stewart- from the Ern Malley hoax

Section 7: First we have the lyrics to "One Winged Angel" by Nobuo Uematsu (in Latin) and Duel of the Fates by John Williams (meaningless). All output by GPT-3 here is largely meaningless. Second we have the lyrics to "Dull Flame of Desire" which is itself a translation of a poem by Fyodor Tyutchev.

Section 8: The lyrics to God Hates America by the Westboro Baptist Church.

Section 9: Wulf & Eadwacer & the Wife's Lament, in translation. BTW, since no one knows for sure, here's my theory about what Wulf & Eadwacer is about, I think it's about a woman who was forced to marry someone she didn't like and misses her lover who is only able to steal into her encampment to see her infrequently. She looks forward to a time that she will be freed, and her son from this bad marriage will be killed.

Section 10: It's all GPT-3. Going to combine it with a traditional Rabinic tale eventually.

Section 11: Me & GPT-3. I had forgotten how derivative the last passage was on Milton, oops.

Section 12: "The Love Song of Alfred J Prufock" (one of the horniest things ever written) , "Fuck the Pain Away" by Peaches and a Zen Koan.

Section 13: Montaigne (the singer) and Ani diFranco (oddly, as quoted in "Empire" by Hardt & Negri).

Section 14: Cantebury tales prologue by Chaucer.

Section 15: La belle dame sans merci, Keats

Section 16: Song of Songs (attributed to Solomon) and A Song of Despair by Pablo Neruda.

Section 17: The two death poems of Seong Sam-mun.

Section 18: The seven kill stelae.

Section 19: The choice of selections as a whole (and references to Matthew Shepard) is influenced by Hal Duncan's "the book of all hours". Howl, the TV tropes wikia, the Ballad of Reading Gaol, In Memoriam A.H.H, Plutarch, the Four Quartets, The Arcadian Shepards
